## Context :
This game was made during the **global game jam 2025** in one week. <br>
The theme of the game jam was **bubbles**, and we oriented the game which takes place into a comic book with NPC's dialogs in bubble to fit the theme.<br>
Consider it as a prototype we still working on.<br>

## About the game : 
The game is in 2d and takes place in a comic book. It's a mix between a puzzle game & a platformer, lead by a strong narrative story.<br>
It tells the life of Jacob, a comic book artist, who drew a comic book about his own life and one day finds himself stuck in it.<br>
The player incarnates Jacob, and discovers the story of his life from his childhood to his adulthood.<br>
The main goal is to find the last page of the comic book, that seems to have been forgotten and lost to time. Jacob will be aided by people he finds in these pages, people he encountered in his real life.<br>
